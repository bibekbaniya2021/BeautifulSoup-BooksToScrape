# BeautifulSoup-BooksToScrape
This is a demo project of using Python, Beautifulsoup, and requests to scrape books displaced at first page of all genre. Also I have included a demo about selecting(using random number) the genre and book title to see its details 

Note: The scripts in this demo works only for "http://books.toscrape.com" website
